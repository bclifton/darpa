Chartered in 1787, Pitt is highly regarded in academic fields ranging from philosophy to medicine, and is well known for the development of the first Polio vaccine as well as its landmark centerpiece building, the Cathedral of Learning.\r\n\r\nFounded as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 on what was then the American frontier, Pitt is one of the oldest continuously chartered institutions of higher education in the United States. Pitt evolved into the Western University of Pennsylvania with an alteration to its charter in 1819, and upon relocating to its current campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1908, the school received its current moniker, the University of Pittsburgh. For most of its history, Pitt was a private institution until it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education in 1966.\r\nPitt's rise from its humble frontier beginnings to its current stature is due in part to its ability to withstand early pressures to abandon its commitment to liberal education. Along the way Pitt has achieved strong reputations in a variety of academic disciplines including philosophy, physics, astronomy, history of science, English literature, creative writing, chemistry, business, biological sciences, information sciences, jazz, engineering, education, international studies, and a variety of medical and health sciences. Pitt regularly produces internationally recognized scholarship and fellowship award winners.\r\n\r\nPitt is popularly recognized for its National Landmark centerpiece building, the Cathedral of Learning at 535 feet (163 m), the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere.", "twitterId": "", "emailDomains": {"_total": 168, "values": ["cbmi.pitt.edu", "list.pitt.edu", "msx.dept-med.pitt.edu", "einstein.phyast.pitt.edu", "bns.pitt.edu", "euler.math.pitt.edu", "gspia.pitt.edu", "pcicirs.pci.pitt.edu", "unixs.cis.pitt.edu", "cidde.pitt.edu", "mail.hgen.pitt.edu", "bc.pitt.edu", "education.pitt.edu", "vireo.lis.pitt.edu", "edc1.gsph.pitt.edu", "semesteratsea.pitt.edu", "vesalius.txs.med.pitt.edu", "library.pitt.edu", "instadv.alumni.pitt.edu", "nueronet.pitt.edu", "ece.pitt.edu", "mail.business.pitt.edu", "pop.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "rcn.wpic.pitt.edu", "cs.pitt.edu", "engrg.pitt.edu", "bruno.phyast.pitt.edu", "law.pitt.edu", "upj.pitt.edu", "police.pitt.edu", "dental.pitt.edu", "dlar.pitt.edu", "sis.pitt.edu", "alumni.pitt.edu", "neurobio.pitt.edu", "my.pitt.edu", "ceoh.pitt.edu", "provost.pitt.edu", "edc.gsph.pitt.edu", "katz.business.pitt.edu", "fmis.facmgmt.pitt.edu", "linflater.pitt.edu", "fritter.phyast.pitt.edu", "helix.hgen.pitt.edu", "exchange.hr.pitt.edu", "hpb.cis.pitt.edu", "ringo.chem.pitt.edu", "imdi.gspia.pitt.edu", "offres.pitt.edu", "siglab.ee.pitt.edu", "ocd.pitt.edu", "hoffman.mgen.pitt.edu", "med.pitt.edu", "ucsur.pitt.edu", "list.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "birch.gspia.pitt.edu", "stophiv.pitt.edu", "prophet.pharm.pitt.edu", "artemis.phyast.pitt.edu", "neurocog.lrdc.pitt.edu", "server.ceoh.pitt.edu", "cgs.pitt.edu", "upci.pitt.edu", "post-ofc06.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "brain.bns.pitt.edu", "neuronet.pitt.edu", "quasar.phyast.pitt.edu", "vms.cis.pitt.edu", "cis.vms.pitt.edu", "engrng.pitt.edu", "druginfonet.pharm-epid.pitt.edu", "phyast.pitt.edu", "upb.pitt.edu", "dorothy.che.pitt.edu", "imap.pitt.edu", "p-and-t.parktran.pitt.edu", "julieta.phyast.pitt.edu", "son.pitt.edu", "athletics.pitt.edu", "sandburg.upj.pitt.edu", "watson.hgen.pitt.edu", "ginie1.sched.pitt.edu", "vms.cls.pitt.edu", "ucis.pitt.edu", "tiamat.phyast.pitt.edu", "wpts.pitt.edu", "cssd.pitt.edu", "otm.tt.pitt.edu", "emmy.mse.pitt.edu", "icarus.lis.pitt.edu", "ain-9.tele.pitt.edu", "isp.pitt.edu", "hs.pitt.edu", "mercury.chem.pitt.edu", "katz.pitt.edu", "exchange.cis.pitt.edu", "jaguar.ee.pitt.edu", "neuwonet.pitt.edu", "studentaffairs.pitt.edu", "orserver.off-res.pitt.edu", "exchange.upb.pitt.edu", "lrdc1.lrdc.pitt.edu", "hp71575h.neuronet.pitt.edu", "athletic.pitt.edu", "gro.pitt.edu", "alumni.business.pitt.edu", "rockwell.business.pitt.edu", "shrs.pitt.edu", "math.pitt.edu", "medstudent.pitt.edu", "arl1.ie.pitt.edu", "pogo.isp.pitt.edu", "cmh.pitt.edu", "hr.pitt.edu", "cis.pitt.edu", "registrar.pitt.edu", "nsabp.pitt.edu", "stargate.pitt.edu", "gsphdean.gsph.pitt.edu", "cadre.dsl.pitt.edu", "kat2.pitt.edu", "merlin.phyast.pitt.edu", "engr.pitt.edu", "epid.wpic.pitt.edu", "pinion.sl.pitt.edu", "civeng1.civ.pitt.edu", "server.pharm.pitt.edu", "mail.sis.pitt.edu", "ccbb.pitt.edu", "lis.pitt.edu", "fm.pitt.edu", "mtac.pitt.edu", "ksads.wpic.pitt.edu", "mgb.pitt.edu", "structbio.pitt.edu", "eoh.pitt.edu", "dom.pitt.edu", "stanley.cs.pitt.edu", "ee.pitt.edu", "pop.pitt.edu", "minerva.phyast.pitt.edu", "fcas.pitt.edu", "lmarcy.pitt.edu", "ryoko.cis.pitt.edu", "tele.pitt.edu", "med1.dept-med.pitt.edu", "civ.pitt.edu", "pitt.edu", "ia.pitt.edu", "bioinformatics.pitt.edu", "unix.cis.pitt.edu", "hgen.pitt.edu", "speedy.cs.pitt.edu", "post-ofc05.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "vms.sic.pitt.edu", "cislabs.pitt.edu", "geezer.lis.pitt.edu", "medschool.pitt.edu", "edc.pitt.edu", "apodaca-renal.dept-med.pitt.edu", "physast1.phyast.pitt.edu", "usenet.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "as.pitt.edu", "csd.pitt.edu", "dean-med.pitt.edu", "farfalle.phyast.pitt.edu", "fs1.dean-med.pitt.edu", "oafa.pitt.edu"]}, "locations": {"_total": 1, "values": [{"contactInfo": {"fax": "", "phone1": "412-624-4141"}, "address": {"postalCode": "15260", "city": "Pittsburgh", "street1": "University of Pittsburgh"}}]}, "employeeCountRange": {"code": "I", "name": "10001+"}, "foundedYear": 1787, "websiteUrl": "http://www.pitt.edu/", "specialties": {"_total": 1, "values": ["Higher Education"]}, "status": {"code": "OPR", "name": "Operating"}, "logoUrl": "https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/7/000/2b5/1b3/37aeefe.png", "universalName": "university-of-pittsburgh", "id": 3461, "companyType": {"code": "D", "name": "Educational"}, "name": "University of Pittsburgh"}, "Boeing Phantom Works": null, "Intelligent Software Solutions, Inc.": {"industries": {"_total": 1, "values": [{"code": "84", "name": "Information Services"}]}, "numFollowers": 32671, "description": "Founded in 1836, Wolters Kluwer (www.wolterskluwer.com) is a market-leading, global information services company focused on professionals in the legal, business, tax, accounting, finance, audit, risk, compliance, and healthcare markets.

Chartered in 1787, Pitt is highly regarded in academic fields ranging from philosophy to medicine, and is well known for the development of the first Polio vaccine as well as its landmark centerpiece building, the Cathedral of Learning.\r\n\r\nFounded as Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 on what was then the American frontier, Pitt is one of the oldest continuously chartered institutions of higher education in the United States. Pitt evolved into the Western University of Pennsylvania with an alteration to its charter in 1819, and upon relocating to its current campus in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh in 1908, the school received its current moniker, the University of Pittsburgh. For most of its history, Pitt was a private institution until it became part of the Commonwealth System of Higher Education in 1966.\r\nPitt's rise from its humble frontier beginnings to its current stature is due in part to its ability to withstand early pressures to abandon its commitment to liberal education. Along the way Pitt has achieved strong reputations in a variety of academic disciplines including philosophy, physics, astronomy, history of science, English literature, creative writing, chemistry, business, biological sciences, information sciences, jazz, engineering, education, international studies, and a variety of medical and health sciences. Pitt regularly produces internationally recognized scholarship and fellowship award winners.\r\n\r\nPitt is popularly recognized for its National Landmark centerpiece building, the Cathedral of Learning at 535 feet (163 m), the tallest educational building in the Western Hemisphere.", "twitterId": "", "emailDomains": {"_total": 168, "values": ["cbmi.pitt.edu", "list.pitt.edu", "msx.dept-med.pitt.edu", "einstein.phyast.pitt.edu", "bns.pitt.edu", "euler.math.pitt.edu", "gspia.pitt.edu", "pcicirs.pci.pitt.edu", "unixs.cis.pitt.edu", "cidde.pitt.edu", "mail.hgen.pitt.edu", "bc.pitt.edu", "education.pitt.edu", "vireo.lis.pitt.edu", "edc1.gsph.pitt.edu", "semesteratsea.pitt.edu", "vesalius.txs.med.pitt.edu", "library.pitt.edu", "instadv.alumni.pitt.edu", "nueronet.pitt.edu", "ece.pitt.edu", "mail.business.pitt.edu", "pop.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "rcn.wpic.pitt.edu", "cs.pitt.edu", "engrg.pitt.edu", "bruno.phyast.pitt.edu", "law.pitt.edu", "upj.pitt.edu", "police.pitt.edu", "dental.pitt.edu", "dlar.pitt.edu", "sis.pitt.edu", "alumni.pitt.edu", "neurobio.pitt.edu", "my.pitt.edu", "ceoh.pitt.edu", "provost.pitt.edu", "edc.gsph.pitt.edu", "katz.business.pitt.edu", "fmis.facmgmt.pitt.edu", "linflater.pitt.edu", "fritter.phyast.pitt.edu", "helix.hgen.pitt.edu", "exchange.hr.pitt.edu", "hpb.cis.pitt.edu", "ringo.chem.pitt.edu", "imdi.gspia.pitt.edu", "offres.pitt.edu", "siglab.ee.pitt.edu", "ocd.pitt.edu", "hoffman.mgen.pitt.edu", "med.pitt.edu", "ucsur.pitt.edu", "list.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "birch.gspia.pitt.edu", "stophiv.pitt.edu", "prophet.pharm.pitt.edu", "artemis.phyast.pitt.edu", "neurocog.lrdc.pitt.edu", "server.ceoh.pitt.edu", "cgs.pitt.edu", "upci.pitt.edu", "post-ofc06.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "brain.bns.pitt.edu", "neuronet.pitt.edu", "quasar.phyast.pitt.edu", "vms.cis.pitt.edu", "cis.vms.pitt.edu", "engrng.pitt.edu", "druginfonet.pharm-epid.pitt.edu", "phyast.pitt.edu", "upb.pitt.edu", "dorothy.che.pitt.edu", "imap.pitt.edu", "p-and-t.parktran.pitt.edu", "julieta.phyast.pitt.edu", "son.pitt.edu", "athletics.pitt.edu", "sandburg.upj.pitt.edu", "watson.hgen.pitt.edu", "ginie1.sched.pitt.edu", "vms.cls.pitt.edu", "ucis.pitt.edu", "tiamat.phyast.pitt.edu", "wpts.pitt.edu", "cssd.pitt.edu", "otm.tt.pitt.edu", "emmy.mse.pitt.edu", "icarus.lis.pitt.edu", "ain-9.tele.pitt.edu", "isp.pitt.edu", "hs.pitt.edu", "mercury.chem.pitt.edu", "katz.pitt.edu", "exchange.cis.pitt.edu", "jaguar.ee.pitt.edu", "neuwonet.pitt.edu", "studentaffairs.pitt.edu", "orserver.off-res.pitt.edu", "exchange.upb.pitt.edu", "lrdc1.lrdc.pitt.edu", "hp71575h.neuronet.pitt.edu", "athletic.pitt.edu", "gro.pitt.edu", "alumni.business.pitt.edu", "rockwell.business.pitt.edu", "shrs.pitt.edu", "math.pitt.edu", "medstudent.pitt.edu", "arl1.ie.pitt.edu", "pogo.isp.pitt.edu", "cmh.pitt.edu", "hr.pitt.edu", "cis.pitt.edu", "registrar.pitt.edu", "nsabp.pitt.edu", "stargate.pitt.edu", "gsphdean.gsph.pitt.edu", "cadre.dsl.pitt.edu", "kat2.pitt.edu", "merlin.phyast.pitt.edu", "engr.pitt.edu", "epid.wpic.pitt.edu", "pinion.sl.pitt.edu", "civeng1.civ.pitt.edu", "server.pharm.pitt.edu", "mail.sis.pitt.edu", "ccbb.pitt.edu", "lis.pitt.edu", "fm.pitt.edu", "mtac.pitt.edu", "ksads.wpic.pitt.edu", "mgb.pitt.edu", "structbio.pitt.edu", "eoh.pitt.edu", "dom.pitt.edu", "stanley.cs.pitt.edu", "ee.pitt.edu", "pop.pitt.edu", "minerva.phyast.pitt.edu", "fcas.pitt.edu", "lmarcy.pitt.edu", "ryoko.cis.pitt.edu", "tele.pitt.edu", "med1.dept-med.pitt.edu", "civ.pitt.edu", "pitt.edu", "ia.pitt.edu", "bioinformatics.pitt.edu", "unix.cis.pitt.edu", "hgen.pitt.edu", "speedy.cs.pitt.edu", "post-ofc05.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "vms.sic.pitt.edu", "cislabs.pitt.edu", "geezer.lis.pitt.edu", "medschool.pitt.edu", "edc.pitt.edu", "apodaca-renal.dept-med.pitt.edu", "physast1.phyast.pitt.edu", "usenet.srv.cis.pitt.edu", "as.pitt.edu", "csd.pitt.edu", "dean-med.pitt.edu", "farfalle.phyast.pitt.edu", "fs1.dean-med.pitt.edu", "oafa.pitt.edu"]}, "locations": {"_total": 1, "values": [{"contactInfo": {"fax": "", "phone1": "412-624-4141"}, "address": {"postalCode": "15260", "city": "Pittsburgh", "street1": "University of Pittsburgh"}}]}, "employeeCountRange": {"code": "I", "name": "10001+"}, "foundedYear": 1787, "websiteUrl": "http://www.pitt.edu/", "specialties": {"_total": 1, "values": ["Higher Education"]}, "status": {"code": "OPR", "name": "Operating"}, "logoUrl": "https://media.licdn.com/mpr/mpr/p/7/000/2b5/1b3/37aeefe.png", "universalName": "university-of-pittsburgh", "id": 3461, "companyType": {"code": "D", "name": "Educational"}, "name": "University of Pittsburgh"}, "Camgian Microsystems Corporation": {"industries": {"_total": 1, "values": [{"code": "7", "name": "Semiconductors"}]}, "numFollowers": 301, "description": "Named by Inc.

This research work resulted in several patents and the products were commercialized in 1996. Initially, the Dynalene branded products (Dynalene MV and Dynalene HF) were sold by Loikits Technologies, Inc. In 1997, a new company named Advanced Fluid Technologies (AFT) was formed to continue the development and commercialization of heat transfer fluids. By 1998, AFT had more than 8 Dynalene branded products covering a very wide temperature range from -112\u00b0C (-170\u00b0F) to 350\u00b0C (662\u00b0F).\r\n \r\nAs the popularity of Dynalene heat transfer fluids grew in a variety of industrial applications, AFT developed several innovative fluids and chemistries to cover as many applications as possible. The Dynalene brand name was well established with over 40 fluids that included several custom fluids made for customers depending on their applications. In 2005, the company changed its name from Advanced Fluid Technologies Inc. to Dynalene Inc. Over the last 5 years, the company has experienced significant growth, and was ranked by Inc. magazine to be among the fastest growing companies for two years.\r\n \r\nDue to the research and instrumentation capabilities developed in the last decade, Dynalene created two business divisions, Dynalene Laboratory Services and Dynalene Nano Materials.
