Drexel's programs are complemented by co-operative education experiences for many of our students, where theory and practice converge.\r\n\r\nA pioneer in co-operative education since 1919, Drexel operates one of the oldest and largest co-operative education programs in the nation. Under the Drexel co-op plan, students attend classes full-time for their entire freshman year. Then, depending on their academic program, they alternate periods of full-time classroom studies and full-time professional employment with University-approved employers. Students can repeat this cycle up to three times, gaining up to 18 months of real-world, professional work experience to complement their diploma.\r\n\r\nDrexel's academic calendar is based on a quarter system; a student's co-op cycle defines which quarters he or she will participate in the co-op experience. For example, students with a fall/winter co-op cycle will work full-time during the fall and winter quarters, while a student with a spring/summer co-op cycle will work full-time during the spring and summer quarters.
