<p>DARPA created the Wound Stasis System (WSS) program to pursue a stabilizing treatment that would keep injured warfighters alive until they could be delivered to a surgical setting. WSS began as a basic research program to identify biological mechanisms for distinguishing between healthy and wounded tissue, with the goal of controlling bleeding by binding to the wound.

<p>WSS now aims to develop a stasis material and delivery system, suitable for use by combat medics at the point of injury, to stabilize a wounded patient for medical transport. Such a system would effectively treat non-compressible wounds, regardless of geometry or location within the abdominal cavity, and would not require direct visualization of the wound by the medic. </p>
<p>The specific goals are to: </p>
<ol>
<li>Develop an agent to achieve rapid hemostasis and maintenance of that hemostasis for non-compressible, abdominal wounds; </li>
<li>Design and demonstrate a portable delivery system to transport sufficient wound stasis material to the wound site; and </li>
<li>Ensure that the hemostatic material can be easily removed in surgical settings. </li>
</ol>
<p>DARPA plans to continue WSS through approval of a prototype device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and will cooperate with the FDA to ensure requirements for approval are fulfilled as rapidly as possible so that a wound stasis treatment can be fielded. To this end, work will continue on acute and chronic safety, biocompatibility, optimum dosing, delivery system design, and verification and validation of the final system. </p>

<p>Although the domain of the Big Mechanism program is cancer biology, the overarching goal of the program is to develop technologies for a new kind of science in which research is integrated more or less immediately—automatically or semi-automatically—into causal, explanatory models of unprecedented completeness and consistency. Cancer pathways are just one example of causal, explanatory models.</p>
<p>The Big Mechanism program will require new research and the integration of several technical areas, particularly statistical and knowledge-based Natural Language Processing (NLP); curation and ontology; systems biology and mathematical biology; representation and reasoning; and quite possibly other areas such as visualization, simulation, and statistical foundations of very large causal networks. Machine reading researchers will need to develop deeper semantics to represent the causal and often kinetic models described in research papers. Deductive inference and qualitative simulation will probably not be sufficient to model the complicated dynamics of signaling pathways and will need to be augmented or replaced by probabilistic and quantitative models. Classification and prediction will continue to be important, but causal explanation is primary. Extant databases and ontologies will provide top-down constraints on reading, assembly of big mechanisms and explanation.</p>

<p>LS3 seeks to demonstrate that a highly mobile, semi-autonomous 
legged robot can carry 400 lbs of a squad’s load, follow squad members through 
rugged terrain and interact with troops in a natural way, similar to a trained 
animal and its handler.</p>
<p>The LS3 program goal is to develop a robot that 
will go through the same terrain the squad goes through without hindering the 
squad’s mission. The robot could also serve as a mobile auxiliary power source 
to the squad, so troops can recharge batteries for radios and handheld devices 
while on patrol.</p>

outdoor assessment, demonstrating mobility by climbing and descending a hill and 
exercising its perception capabilities.</p>
<p>A two-year, platform-refinement 
test cycle began in July 2012, with Marine and Army involvement, culminating in 
a planned capstone exercise where LS3 should embed with Marines conducting field 
exercises. During this period, DARPA seeks to finish the development of and 
refine LS3’s technologies to provide a suite of autonomy settings, including 
leader-follower tight, leader-follower corridor and go-to-waypoint, described 
below: </p>
<ul>
<li>Leader-follower tight: LS3 attempts to follow as close as 
possible to the path its leader takes</li>
<li>Leader-follower corridor: LS3 
sticks to the leader but has freedom to make local path decisions, so the leader 
doesn’t need to think about LS3’s mobility capabilities</li>
<li>Go-to-waypoint: 
LS3 uses its local perception to avoid obstacles on its way to a designated GPS 
coordinate</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, technologies to allow squad members to 
speak commands to LS3 are anticipated to be added during this period. </p>
<p>LS3 represents the culmination of a decade of research in perception and 
autonomy with programs like DARPA’s Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle-Perception 
for Off-Road Robotics Integration (UPI) program, mobility work with DARPA’s “Big

These capabilities are being investigated through two efforts.</p>, <p>ADEPT - Diagnostics on Demand (DxOD): DxOD aims to enable in-vitro devices that address current clinical diagnostic needs and are reconfigurable to decrease the time to design, manufacture and rapidly distribute assays in response to an emerging diagnostic need.  The program is addressing diagnostic technologies for use in two settings: diagnostics tailored for self-performed tests in limited resource settings and in point-of-care settings.  These efforts will improve diagnostic capability and medical care in garrison, as well as in field, fleet, and air transport settings.  An additional thrust of the DxOD effort includes capabilities to preserve, ship, archive and recover biomarkers from a self-collected biospecimen.</p>, <p>DARPA released a Request For Information related to this facet of the ADEPT program on November 14, 2011.</p>]"

<p>The ADAPT program seeks novel techniques and processes to rapidly develop low-cost ISR sensor systems by adapting commercial manufacturing approaches. The primary goal of the ADAPT program is to deliver common hardware and software that can be quickly configured to perform a variety of mission-specific ISR applications.</p>
<p>The elements of the ADAPT concept are divided into three areas: A reusable hardware core, reusable software, and sensor-specific applications. The reusable hardware core aims to leverage low-cost commercial components available at the time of manufacture, enabling it to be refreshed at the rate of commercial technologies. For example, commercial consumer electronic products are typically developed using Original Design Manufacturers (ODM) who promote fabless product development in factories that make a large number of variations on similar products. ADAPT seeks to use ODMs for design and production rather than the common practice of using contract manufacturers.</p>
<p>Reusable software efforts will addresses sensor management functions such as processing, storage, communications, navigation and orientation—all of which are common to a wide variety of sensor systems. These are also the same types of functions used in smart phone products which will allow leveraging of commercial technology for economies of scale. Consumer software can be developed quickly by using open-source software frameworks that include application development and distribution environments. These rich software tools and libraries create opportunities for nimble, third party application developers to rapidly create and refine software products. The ADAPT program will leverage similar commercial software development environments for smartphone products to enable new classes of sensor system application developers.</p>
<p>Sensors currently require production of common hardware and software for each sensor-specific application.  Sensors created in the ADAPT program will benefit from not having to develop and produce common hardware and software. Military missions will define specific sensors, packaging and power systems to be used depending upong the mission performance requirements.

As a result, warfighters may require multiple missile launches and overhead targeting assets to engage specific enemy warships from beyond the reach of counter-fire systems.</p>
<p>To overcome these challenges, the joint DARPA - Navy Long Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM) program is investing in advanced technologies to provide a leap ahead in U.S. surface warfare capability. The LRASM program aims to reduce dependence on intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) platforms, network links, and GPS navigation in electronic warfare environments.  Autonomous guidance algorithms should allow the LRASM to use less-precise target cueing data to pinpoint specific targets in the contested domain. The program also focuses on innovative terminal survivability approaches and precision lethality in the face of advanced counter measures. </p>
<p>The LRASM program began in 2009 to ensure that the United States leads technology advancement for best-in-world operational Anti-Surface Warfare capability into the future. The program, currently in the second of two phases, initially focused on technology for two variants, the LRASM-A and LRASM-B. LRASM-A leverages the state-of-the-art Joint Air to Surface Standoff Missile Extended Range (JASSM-ER) airframe and incorporates additional sensors and systems to achieve a stealthy and survivable subsonic cruise missile. Designs for LRASM-B focused on operating at the other end of the spectrum for precision strike weapons—high-altitude and supersonic speed over stealthy penetration.</p>
<p>Working in close collaboration with the Navy to provide warfighters a capability that can make a difference at sea in the near term, DARPA decided in January 2012 to focus solely on technology development for LRASM-A, ceasing development of LRASM-B. By consolidating investments to focus solely on advancing LRASM-A technologies, DARPA aims to reduce risk and expedite delivery of cutting-edge capability to the fleet. </p>
<p>DARPA began captive carry flight tests of LRASM sensors aboard a research aircraft in May 2012. The first captive carry test aboard a modified Sabreliner business jet successfully demonstrated all elements of the integrated sensor suite, including sensing and fuzing targets and validation of the geolocation algorithm. The sensor suite performed as planned, paving the way for additional captive carry tests in increasingly complex simulated scenarios through the remainder of 2012 and beginning of 2013.</p>
<p>DARPA originally scheduled two air-launched flight demonstrations for early 2013. In March 2013, DARPA increased the scope of the program to include a third flight to further mature key technologies in preparation for transition opportunities. Captive carry events will continue over the next several months, with the first live-fire exercise slated for Summer 2013. </p>
<p>Additionally, DARPA has begun an effort to integrate the LRASM for launch from a surface vessel. In support of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, DARPA is addressing the long-lead developmental tasks including modifications to the missile airframe, design of the booster separation system and development of a new hybrid canister to accommodate the LRASM. DARPA also plans to address surface-launched risk reduction (SLRR) issues. Two ballistic test surface launches are planned for the end of 2014.</p>
<p>The LRASM program is on track to deliver an advanced prototype weapon to the Navy and Air Force with capability for challenging future operational environments, while being sufficiently mature to transition rapidly to an acquisition program to address near-term operational challenges. </p>
<p>Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control (LMMFC) Strike Weapons, Orlando, Fla., is the performer for the demonstration of the LRASM weapon, and BAE Systems, Information and Electronic Systems Integration, Nashua, NH, is the performer for the design and delivery of onboard sensor systems.</p>

This data deluge is pervasive throughout the military and applies to single and multi-modal sensing platforms.  Today, sensors ingest and process raw signals and output sensing products. Exploitation algorithms operate on these products, and human analysts interpret their content. Hence, under the current paradigm, the semantics derived from sensor outputs do not emerge until an analyst has assimilated the data. </p>, <p><p>The goal of the Mathematics of Sensing, Exploitation and Execution (MSEE) program is to explore and develop high-impact methods for scalable autonomous systems capable of understanding scenes and events for learning, planning, and execution of complex tasks.  The program is exploring powerful mathematical frameworks for unified knowledge representation for shared perception, learning, reasoning, and action. One of the central concepts in MSEE is to exploit methods based on minimalist generative grammar, similar to human language, to represent and process visual scenes and actions. Data-driven methods for spatial, temporal, and causal parsing of information are being developed for semantic understanding of scenes and events in unstructured environments along with cognitive processing methods for exploitation and manipulations. The foundational premise of the program is that a comprehensive mathematical framework to describe an integrated SEE system would allow for detailed analysis of its potential performance and serve as a guide to prototype design. Methods will be demonstrated in use cases motivated by defense applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and vision-guided robots to perform repairs. </p>

Hence, under the current paradigm, the semantics derived from sensor outputs do not emerge until an analyst has assimilated the data. </p>
<p>As a result of this dynamics, three challenges emerge:</p>
<ul type=""disc"">
<ol type=""1"">
<li>Data's worth can only be evaluated after analysts have interpreted it, and with knowledge of how it will be used; </li>
<li>Prior knowledge, including that which may have accrued during previous processing, is not used during the production of sensor output products, thus sensors process their signals as if they were seeing the world anew at every instant; </li>
<li>In the presence of multiple sensors, analysts must reconstruct a unified view out of sensor output products that were not, in general, designed for integration.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<p>A new approach to sensing is required to confront these shortcomings. An effective representation for recognizing objects, attributes and actions, and for parsing spatial-temporal relational information, would result in scalable platforms capable of autonomous learning, inference, reasoning, planning and execution of complex tasks. </p>
<p>MSEE includes three planned phases. The goal of Phase I is to create the mathematical foundation for a representation-centric model. The goal of Phase II is to refine the representation constructed in an initial software system able to answer queries related to the content of sensor data from a single modality. The goal of Phase III is to develop a fully integrated, modular system that demonstrates quantitative and qualitative analyses of systems that integrate sensing/perception, exploitation, and execution, with multi-modal sensor data. This implementation-ready software must be able to address queries related to data content, and learn and perform task/objective specific actions with far better performance than non-integrative methods</p>
<p>To date, performers on MSEE have pursued fundamental research into the nature of stochastic modeling and knowledge representation. These basic tools are being used to build prototype systems. Progress in these areas should greatly advance DoD's ability to build high-performance systems in a number of areas including ISR and supervised robust autonomous systems.</p>
</p>, <p>The goal of the Mathematics of Sensing, Exploitation and Execution (MSEE) program is to explore and develop high-impact methods for scalable autonomous systems capable of understanding scenes and events for learning, planning, and execution of complex tasks.  The program is exploring powerful mathematical frameworks for unified knowledge representation for shared perception, learning, reasoning, and action. One of the central concepts in MSEE is to exploit methods based on minimalist generative grammar, similar to human language, to represent and process visual scenes and actions. Data-driven methods for spatial, temporal, and causal parsing of information are being developed for semantic understanding of scenes and events in unstructured environments along with cognitive processing methods for exploitation and manipulations. The foundational premise of the program is that a comprehensive mathematical framework to describe an integrated SEE system would allow for detailed analysis of its potential performance and serve as a guide to prototype design. Methods will be demonstrated in use cases motivated by defense applications such as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) and vision-guided robots to perform repairs. </p>, <p>The MSEE program aims to address a growing difficulty: The amount of data collected by DoD sensor systems exceeds the ability of human analysts and current automated decision systems to extract actionable information.

This will be achieved by developing new electronic processing subsystems methods and architectures based on new understandings of mathematical principles and embedded signal processing. This program will develop ultra-wideband digital RF receivers based on A-to-I converter (AIC) technology. AICs will loosen the traditionally rigid tradeoff of frequency coverage against dynamic range in digital receiver applications using a family of novel mathematical algorithms and representations known as compressive sampling.  Compared to conventional RF receivers based on a mixture of RF down converters and conventional analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) or the emerging generation direct digital receivers also based on ADCs, AIC-based designs will increase receiver dynamic range and frequency band of regard while reducing power consumption and size.  AIC designs will be efficient, reducing or eliminating the need for post-sensing digital compression, reducing data glut and minimizing bandwidth for transmission downlinks and/or data storage. RF receiver system prototypes suitable for a variety of challenging DoD application areas will be developed and demonstrated in a brass board form factor under realistic RF environments. Likewise, simultaneously achieving high operational bandwidth, linearity, and efficiency of high power transmitter amplifiers has remained a significant technical challenge. These limitations of current art power amplifier technology have resulted in well documented instances of electronic fratricide.  The A-to-I Look-Thru program will overcome these limitations by converting digital signals directly to high power RF analog signals, thus eliminating the traditional high power amplifiers that are limited by the tradeoffs between bandwidth, output power, efficiency and linearity.</p>]"

 (ASW) Continuous Trail Unmanned Vessel (ACTUV) is developing an unmanned vessel 
 optimized to robustly track quiet diesel electric submarines. The program is  
structured around three primary goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore the performance potential of a surface platform  
conceived from concept to field demonstration under the premise that a human is  
never intended to step aboard at any point in its operating cycle.  As a 
 result,  a new design paradigm emerges with reduced constraints on conventional 
 naval  architecture elements such as layout, accessibility, crew support 
 systems, and  reserve buoyancy. The objective is to generate a vessel design 
 that exceeds  state-of-the art platform performance to provide propulsive 
 overmatch against  diesel electric submarines at a fraction of their size and 
 cost. <br/> </li>
<li>Advance unmanned maritime system autonomy to enable 
 independently deploying  systems capable of missions spanning thousands of 
 kilometers of range and months  of endurance under a sparse remote supervisory 
 control model.  This includes  autonomous compliance with maritime laws and 
 conventions for safe navigation,  autonomous system management for operational 
 reliability, and autonomous  interactions with an intelligent adversary.<br/> </li>
<li>Demonstrate the capability  of the ACTUV system to use its unique 
 characteristics to employ non-conventional  sensor technologies that achieve 
 robust continuous track of the quietest  submarine targets over their entire 
 operating envelope. </li>
</ul>
<p>While the ACTUV program is 
focused on  demonstrating the ASW tracking  capability in this configuration, 
the core  platform and autonomy technologies  are broadly extendable to underpin 
a wide  range of missions and configurations  for future unmanned naval 
vessels.</p>
<p>The program has four phases. During  phase 1, the program 
refined and  validated the system concept and associated  performance metrics, 
completing  risk reduction testing to inform program risks  associated with 
submarine  tracking sensors and maritime autonomy. In August  2012, DARPA 
awarded a  contract for phases 2-4.  The program plans the following  in 
upcoming phases:  Design a vessel (Phase 2); Build a vessel (Phase 3) and test  
the vessel (Phase  4). Operational prototype at-sea testing is expected in  
mid-2015.</p>

<p>LS3 seeks to demonstrate that a highly mobile, semi-autonomous

rugged terrain and interact with troops in a natural way, similar to a trained 
animal and its handler.</p>
<p>The LS3 program goal is to develop a robot that 
will go through the same terrain the squad goes through without hindering the

while on patrol.</p>

outdoor assessment, demonstrating mobility by climbing and descending a hill and 
exercising its perception capabilities.</p>
<p>A two-year, platform-refinement 
test cycle began in July 2012, with Marine and Army involvement, culminating in 
a planned capstone exercise where LS3 should embed with Marines conducting field 
exercises. During this period, DARPA seeks to finish the development of and 
refine LS3’s technologies to provide a suite of autonomy settings, including 
leader-follower tight, leader-follower corridor and go-to-waypoint, described 
below: </p>
<ul>
<li>Leader-follower tight: LS3 attempts to follow as close as 
possible to the path its leader takes</li>
<li>Leader-follower corridor: LS3 
sticks to the leader but has freedom to make local path decisions, so the leader 
doesn’t need to think about LS3’s mobility capabilities</li>
<li>Go-to-waypoint: 
LS3 uses its local perception to avoid obstacles on its way to a designated GPS 
coordinate</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, technologies to allow squad members to 
speak commands to LS3 are anticipated to be added during this period. </p>
<p>LS3 represents the culmination of a decade of research in perception and 
autonomy with programs like DARPA’s Unmanned Ground Combat Vehicle-Perception 
for Off-Road Robotics Integration (UPI) program, mobility work with DARPA’s “Big

As a result, a substantial number of DoD systems are dependent on GPS data to provide accurate position, direction of motion, and time information. This dependence creates a critical vulnerability for many DoD systems in situations where the intended targets are either equipped with high-power jammers or the GPS signal is compromised.</p>
<p>The goal of the Micro-Technology for Positioning, Navigation and Timing (Micro-PNT) program is to develop technology for self-contained, chip-scale inertial navigation and precision guidance for munitions as well as mounted or dismounted soldiers. Size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP+C) are key concerns in the overall system design of compact navigation systems. Breakthroughs in microfabrication techniques may allow for the development of a single package containing all of the necessary devices (clocks, accelerometers, and gyroscopes) incorporated into a small (8 mm<sup>3</sup>) low-power (1 W) timing and inertial measurement unit. On-chip calibration should enable periodic internal error correction to reduce drift and thereby enable more accurate devices.

<p>The developments consider a number of operational scenarios, ranging from dismounted-soldier navigation to navigation, guidance and Control (NG&amp;C) of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs), Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs), and guided missiles. The micro-PNT initiatives seek to increase the dynamic range of inertial sensors, reduce long-term drift in clocks and inertial sensors, and to develop miniature chips providing position, orientation, and time information.  </p>

The gimbal, however, tends to be the largest, slowest and most expensive component in the optical system. Drawing on phased array concepts that revolutionized RADAR technology, the Short-Range, Wide Field-of-View Extremely agile, Electronically Steered Photonic Emitter (SWEEPER) program will develop a compact, agile alternative to mechanical beam-steering.   The SWEEPER program seeks to extend phased array beam-steering to the optical domain in the near infrared (0.8 to 2 μm range) by developing optical phased arrays and building on recent advances in photonic integrated circuit (PIC) technology such as increased photonic device density and circuit complexity.</p>
<p>The SWEEPER program seeks to develop an optical phased array (64 X 64 elements) capable of agile (greater than 4x106 o/sec) beam-steering with a high degree of side-lobe suppression (30 dB) and a wide field of view (-45o to +45o) based on PIC technology.  Such arrays will require the integration and precise relative electronic phase control of thousands of closely packed optical emitting facets within a very small form factor.  By developing this array of emitters with multiple degrees of freedom for phase control, the SWEEPER program not only enables agile beam steering but also beam-forming and multiple beam generation. </p>
<p>Historically, the development of RF phased arrays impacted critical applications such as multi-target tracking for fire control systems and directed beams for low probability-of-intercept communications. Successful development of SWEEPER technology will enable optical phased arrays with analogous impact. Compact implementations enabled by PIC technology will be particularly important for small, SWAP-limited, platforms.  The potential application-space for this program is broad, encompassing surveillance, 3D imaging, precision targeting, guidance, navigation and LADAR mapping of buildings and caves.</p>

Strategic Social Interaction Modules (SSIM),http://www.darpa.mil/Our_Work/BTO/Programs/Strategic_Social_Interaction_Modules_SSIM.aspx,"[<p>In contemporary military operations, servicemembers are called on to act as street-level diplomats, negotiators, peacekeepers, law enforcement officers and relief workers.</p>, <p><p>In contemporary military operations, servicemembers are called on to act as street-level diplomats, negotiators, peacekeepers, law enforcement officers and relief workers. Because their military training, however, focuses primarily on kinetic operations, many servicemembers, especially those junior in age and experience, find these roles unfamiliar and challenging.  Most existing training for non-kinetic operations is limited in time and scope and typically emphasizes general familiarization with language and culture, rather than building fundamental skills that enable such specific knowledge to be implemented successfully. While some highly effective military training programs focus on enhancing servicemembers’ capacity to function in non-kinetic social encounters, they tend to be extremely costly and manpower intensive.</p>
<p>The Strategic Social Interaction Modules program (SSIM) seeks to develop innovative, cost-effective methods for training warfighters in the basic human dynamics skills and proficiencies needed to enter into social encounters, regardless of the cultural, linguistic, or other contextual parameters.  Rather than developing language and culture-specific knowledge, SSIM focuses on developing unique pedagogical and technological tools for enhancing the fundamental skills and proficiencies  necessary for successfully managing and conducting social interaction in which participants do not share a common language, culture, or other set of defining experiences. SSIM-based training aims to enable servicemembers to approach and engage strangers in unfamiliar social environments, orient to unfamiliar patterns of behavior, recover from social errors, de-escalate conflict, integrate tact and tactics, transition in and out of force situations, and engage in the process of discovering and adapting to previously unknown ""rules of the game"" intrinsic to social engagements.</p>
<p>SSIM research focuses on three major technical areas:  the science of social interactions and human dynamics, technological and pedagogical design of training tools for developing human dynamics interaction proficiencies, and assessment of SSIM training and subsequent performance outcomes.  SSIM research aims to identify and codify the constitutive elements of successful social interaction skills; to develop a training simulator with virtual social interaction space operating in support of human-based training; and to develop techniques to measure the effectiveness of SSIM training and wider longitudinal outcomes.</p>
<p>At the start of the program, an array of military, law enforcement, academic, and industry experts provided DARPA with insight into the science of human interactions, the training of servicemembers and law enforcement officers, and the development of integrated evaluation techniques for assessing the quality of military and law enforcement interactions with strangers. In addition to developing new knowledge and techniques for the military, SSIM will aim to develop and transition measurement tools for use in training and real-world settings, which will enable researchers, trainers, and organizational leaders to assess social performance and its outcomes and effects.</p>
